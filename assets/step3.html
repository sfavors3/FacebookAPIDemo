		<h1>Step 3: Create New Facebook SDK Project</h1>
		<p>For the first time, you will need to create a new Android project for the Facebook SDK source which can be reference from your app. This is only required once. Open Eclipse and create a new Android Project (File | New | Project | Android Project) for the Facebook Android SDK source and later reference it from your app. Get the content by selecting <b>Create project from existing source</b> and specifying the facebook directory from your git repository (<b>~/facebook-android-sdk/facebook</b>).</p>

		<p class="note">Notes: The project you just created is just a dummy project, which basically serves as a library for your own projects. This means that it can not really be run on you phone/emulator. However, you have to leave this project open in your Eclipse Project Explorer, or your own projects will complain.</p>
