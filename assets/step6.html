		<h1>Step 6: Enable Single Sign-On for your App</h1>

		<p>Single Sign-On allows user to authorize your app without typing their facebook username and password. This is accomplished by sharing intent with the Facebook app. If the user has already installed and authorized the facebook app, your app can leverage the Facebook app authentication via Single Sign On. It is highly recommended that you implement SSO for your app to enable frictionless authorization.Note that the SSO will fall back to webview based oauth dialg if the Facebook app is not installed on the handset.</p>

		<h3>Step 6.1: Modify the AndroidManifest.xml for the Network calls</h3>

		<p>Once the Facebook SDK is referenced, the app <b>manifest</b> needs to be modified to allow the app to make network calls to Facebook. This is accomplished by adding the following to the AndroidManifest.xml file in the app project (Note that by default the Eclipse may open the <b>Manifest</b> tab. Click on the <b>AndroidManifest.xml</b> tab in the editor's bottom bar to open the editor view):</p>

		<pre>
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"&gt;
		</pre>
		
		<div align="center">
			<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_Manifest.png">
				<img width="300px" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_Manifest.png"></img>
			</a>
		</div>

		<h3>Step 6.2: Single-Sign-On (SSO)</h3>

		<p>As with the iOS SDK, one of the most compelling features of the Android SDK is <b>Single-Sign-On (SSO)</b>. SSO lets users sign into your app using their Facebook identity.  If they are already signed into the Facebook Android app on their device they do not have to even type a username and password. Further, because they are signing to your app with their Facebook identity, you will have access to their profile information and social graph.</p>

		<p>Adding SSO to your app is very simple with the Facebook SDK. The below example outlines what code must be written to enable this feature. For the sake of simplicity, SSO functionality will be added to the Activity that was created by Eclipse when the app project was created. Open the MyGreatApp project->src->com.greatapp->MyGreatActivity.java. Replace the existing code by Copy-paste the code below while <b>replacing the "YOUR_APP_ID" with the "APP_ID"</b> of your app and save the file:</p>

		<pre>
package com.greatapp;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;
import com.facebook.android.*;
import com.facebook.android.Facebook.*;

public class MyGreatActivity extends Activity {
	
	Facebook facebook = new Facebook("YOUR_APP_ID");

	@Override
	public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.main);

		facebook.authorize(this, new DialogListener() {
			@Override
		    public void onComplete(Bundle values) {}

		    @Override
		    public void onFacebookError(FacebookError error) {}

		    @Override
		    public void onError(DialogError e) {}

		    @Override
		    public void onCancel() {}
		 });
	}

	@Override
	public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
		super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
		
		facebook.authorizeCallback(requestCode, resultCode, data);
	}
}
		</pre>

		<h3>Step 6.3: Install the Facebook Android App</h3>

		<p>To help with debugging your app in the Android emulator, we provide a binary image of the Facebook Android app that you can install with the <code>adb</code> tool in the Android SDK. Launch the emulator for the Android 2.2 (the target selected when creating the project) by going to Window -> Android SDK and AVD Manager):</p>

		<div align="center">
			<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/Android_Emulator.png">
				<img width="300px" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/Android_Emulator.png"></img>
			</a>
		</div>

		<p>Run the following command. The adb tool is part of the standard android SDK and located in the android_sdk/platform-tools/ folder.</p>

		<pre>
adb install ~/facebook-android-sdk/Facebook.apk
		</pre>

		<p>If you are running one or more emulators/devices you also need to specify the target instance for the install. For more information see <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html#directingcommands">the Android documentation</a>.</p>

		<p>Your app will still work without installing this image, but we will default to using Platform Dialogs for sign-in rather than using the Facebook App requiring user to sign-in every time you run your app in the emulator.</p>

		<h3>Step 6.4: Build and run the project</h3>

		<p>Build and run the 'MyGreatApp' project. This should launch in the same emulator where you installed the Facebook.apk. You will be prompted with the user authorization dialog:</p>

		<div align="center">
			<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_basicperm.png">
				<img width="300px" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_basicperm.png"></img>
			</a>
		</div>

		<p>Note: You may have to login to the Facebook app the very first time before you see the authorization dialog. If you have turned on Login Approvals for Facebook and you are using the binary image of the Facebook Android app, you may see an error after entering your password. Simply enter the login approval code to complete the login and see the authorization dialog.</p>

		<p>This dialog allows the user to grant your app permission to access their information. If the user presses <b>Allow</b>, your app is authorized and you will have access to the user's profile and social graph through the <code>facebook</code> instance.  If the user presses <b>Don't Allow</b>, your app is not authorized and you will not have access to the user's data.</p>

		<p>If you do not see a permissions dialog then your Android application signature may not match the app settings on Facebook. This can happen if you chose to get your Android application signature from debug logs or if there is a mismatch in the application signature generated through the Java JDK keytool.</p>

		<p>To resolve this check your Android SDK debug logs. Make sure you enabled logging in the Android SDK's <code>Util.java</code> file. Look at your log entries for an entry with ''Android key mismatch''. This error will also provide you with the key that was sent to Facebook. Note the key's value and enter it into your <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps">Facebook app settings</a>.</p>

		<p>Be sure to turn off debugging in the Android SDK once Single Sign On completes successfully. To do this modify <code>Util.java</code>:</p>

		<pre>
private static boolean ENABLE_LOG = false;
		</pre>

		<h3>Step 6.5: More permissions</h3>

		<p>By default, the user is asked to authorize the app to access basic information that is available publicly or by default on Facebook. If your app needs more than this basic information to function, you must request specific permissions from the user.  This is accomplished by passing <code>String[]</code> of permissions to the <code>authorize</code> method.  The following example shows how to ask for access to user's email address, get extended access token and check-in user at a place:</p>

		<pre>
facebook.authorize(this, new String[] { "email", "publish_checkins" },

	new DialogListener() {
		@Override
		public void onComplete(Bundle values) {}
		
		@Override
		public void onFacebookError(FacebookError error) {}

		@Override
		public void onError(DialogError e) {}

		@Override
		public void onCancel() {}
	}
);
		</pre>

		<p>This shows an additional permissions screen where user can allow access to all, some or none permissions:</p>

		<div align="center">
			<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_moreperm_email.png">
				<img width="300px" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_moreperm_email.png"/></img>
			</a>
		</div>

		<div align="center">
			<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_morepermissions.png">
				<img width="300px" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_morepermissions.png"></img>
			</a>
		</div>

		<p>A full list of permissions is available in our <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions">permissions reference</a>. There is a strong inverse correlation between the number of permissions your app requests and the number of users that will allow those permissions. The greater the number of permissions you ask for, the lower the number of users that will grant them; so we recommend that you only request the permissions you absolutely need for your app.</p>

		<p>If you need to ask for additional permissions after requesting an initial set you can call the <code>authorize</code> method and pass in the new permissions you want. Also note that the user may revoke permissions already granted for your app through their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications">Facebook settings</a>. You should check for available permissions through the Graph API's <code>/me/permissions</code> endpoint. See the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Graph API</a> section for more information on how to make a Graph API call.</p>

		<h3>Step 6.6: Save your access token</h3>

		<p>If you run the project again (after user has initially authorized your app), you will notice that user is presented with the following dialog:</p>

		<div align="center">
			<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_tosed.png">
				<img width="300px" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/AndroidSSO_tosed.png"></img>
			</a>
		</div>

		<p>This dialog is displayed to mask the abrupt app-switching between your app and the Facebook app while Facebook SDK gets the access token for your app. To get rid of this dialog, let's rework on the previous code by using the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#pref">Shared Preferences</a>.</p>

		<pre>
package com.greatapp;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.os.Bundle;
import com.facebook.android.*;
import com.facebook.android.Facebook.*;

public class MyGreatActivity extends Activity {

	Facebook facebook = new Facebook("YOUR_APP_ID");
	private SharedPreferences mPrefs;

	@Override
	public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.main);
		/*
		 * Get existing access_token if any
		 */
		mPrefs = getPreferences(MODE_PRIVATE);
		String access_token = mPrefs.getString("access_token", null);
		long expires = mPrefs.getLong("access_expires", 0);
		if(access_token != null) {
			facebook.setAccessToken(access_token);
		}
		if(expires != 0) {
			facebook.setAccessExpires(expires);
		}

		/*
		 * Only call authorize if the access_token has expired.
		 */
		if(!facebook.isSessionValid()) {
			
			facebook.authorize(this, new String[] {}, new DialogListener() {
				@Override
				public void onComplete(Bundle values) {
					SharedPreferences.Editor editor = mPrefs.edit();
					editor.putString("access_token", facebook.getAccessToken());
					editor.putLong("access_expires", facebook.getAccessExpires());
					editor.commit();
				}
				
				@Override
				public void onFacebookError(FacebookError error) {}
				
				@Override
				public void onError(DialogError e) {}

				@Override
				public void onCancel() {}
			});
		}
	}

	@Override
	public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
		super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
		
		facebook.authorizeCallback(requestCode, resultCode, data);
	}
}
		</pre>

		<p>If you save and run this (remember to replace "YOUR_APP_ID" with your app_id, you will notice that no authorization or confirmation dialog is displayed and user stays within your app. So, what's changed:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>The access token is saved using SharedPreferences in the <b>onComplete()</b> method</li>
		<li>The saved access token is fetched from persistent storage and set as the facebook object's access token via <b>facebook.setAccessToken()</b></li>
		<li><b>facebook.authorize()</b> is called only if the session is invalid. (checked by calling the <b>facebook.isSessionValid()</b>).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>However, note that this doesn't account for the situation where user may have revoked access to your app or if user has changed his password. You will need to always look out for the invalid access_token and redirect user to re-authorize your app. For invalid access token, following error is returned in the 'response' parameter of the onComplete() method:</p>

		<pre>
User revoked access to your app:
{"error":{"type":"OAuthException","message":"Error validating access token: User 1053947411 has not authorized application 157111564357680."}}

OR when password changed:
{"error":{"type":"OAuthException","message":"Error validating access token: The session is invalid because the user logged out."}}
		</pre>
		
		<p class="note">Notes: These are pretty much everything you need to know about facebook sign in and <code>facebook.authorize()</code> method. You will see these in action in the <b>Sign In</b> module of this app.</p>
